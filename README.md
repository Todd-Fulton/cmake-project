A cmake project template with a few utilities that I personally use such as vcpkg.

If you use this as a base, make sure to update project name, this `README.md`, the `UNLICENSE` file, etc.

Feel free to submit pull requests to fix issues or request a useful feature.

## Note:
This should not be considered "production ready cmake", it's meant to get up and running without having to repeat boilerplate.
